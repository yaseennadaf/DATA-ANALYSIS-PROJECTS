 # EDA on Haberman's Cancer Dataset
 
### Category of Project
- Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Data Preprocessing and Data Visualisation

### Tools Used
- Python 3, Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, Numpy, Pandas Profiling

### Description of Project
- Link to the original dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/gilsousa/habermans-survival-data-set. The dataset contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.

- In the preliminary EDA phase we will try to find general information about the data like number of rows, columns, type of variables, checking for missing values, minimum, maximum, mean values etc.
- In the second phase we will try to perfom univariate analysis on individual variables and see how they are distributed by plotting and visually oberving and understanding the patterns.
- In the third phase we will try to perfom multivariate analysis on pairs of variables and check the interactions between them by plotting visualizations.
- Once we perform univariate and mulivariate analysis we can again formulate some new questions/objectives based on the findings and try to search for the answers.
